# Laurentides-region-housing-market

We are in January 2021 and the Covid-19 pandemic his driving the housing market in the Montreal region to new highs. My partner and I have the desire to get ''on the train'' while we can and before the prices are to steep. This study is meant for us to understand the market and help us make a good decision regarding the house we will buy. It also lays the foundations for further possible business developments.

The study will be biased towards our dream house characteristics:

 - Minimum three bedrooms
 - Minimum two bathroooms
 - A decently sized house - between 1200 and 1500 sq.ft
 - A decently sized land - between 10000 and 20000 sq.ft away from road noise
 - A garage so I can fullfill my handyman side


#### Business questions this study intends to answer:
-Study the Laurentides region market characteristics: i.e. statistical analysis of current listings
-Be able to provide a market price for a potential new listing using its characteristics
-Be able to tell if any of the current listings are considered under-priced, fairly-priced or over-priced

#### Data characteristics:
123 house listings were manually (because a lot of variables are subjective and needed analysis) gathered between the last week of December 2020 and the first week of January 2021. They represent all the listings for houses with prices between 200000 and 500000$ and located within the following municipalities: Piedmont, Sainte-Ad√®le, Saint-Sauveur, Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, Val-David, Saint-Adolphe-d'Howard, Morin-Heights and Val-Morin.
